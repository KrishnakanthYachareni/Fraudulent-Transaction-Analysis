### Data Wrangling - Duplicate Transactions
You will notice a number of what look like duplicated transactions in the data set. One type of duplicated transaction is a reversed transaction, where a purchase is followed by a reversal. Another example is a multi-swipe, where a vendor accidentally charges a customer's card multiple times within a short time span.

programmatically identify reversed and multi-swipe transactions and total number of transactions and total dollar amount estimate for the reversed transactions. For the multi-swipe transactions? (consider the first transaction to be "normal" and exclude it from the number of transaction and dollar amount counts)
